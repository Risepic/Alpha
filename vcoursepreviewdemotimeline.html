    <p class="contentprewboxinfo-box-kindsofdesc">A tutorial is a method of transferring knowledge and may be used as a part of a learning process. More interactive and specific than a book or a lecture, a tutorial seeks to teach by example and supply the information to complete a certain task. A tutorial can be taken in many forms, ranging from a set of instructions to complete a task to an interactive problem solving session (usually in academia).</p>

          <p>Video technology was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) television systems, but several new technologies for video display devices have since been invented. Video was originally exclusively a live technology. Charles Ginsburg led an Ampex research team developing one of the first practical video tape recorder (VTR). In 1951 the first video tape recorder captured live images from television cameras by converting the camera's electrical impulses and saving the information onto magnetic video tape. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#VideoHistory</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#CRT</span></p>

          <p>The use of digital techniques in video created digital video, which allows higher quality and, eventually, much lower cost than earlier analog technology. After the invention of the DVD in 1997 and Blu-ray Disc in 2006, sales of videotape and recording equipment plummeted. Advances in computer technology allows even inexpensive personal computers and smartphones to capture, store, edit and transmit digital video, further reducing the cost of video production, allowing program-makers and broadcasters to move to tapeless production. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#VideoHistory</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Digital</span></p>

          <p>Frame rate, the number of still pictures per unit of time of video, ranges from six or eight frames per second (frame/s) for old mechanical cameras to 120 or more frames per second for new professional cameras. PAL standards (Europe, Asia, Australia, etc.) and SECAM (France, Russia, parts of Africa etc.) specify 25 frame/s, while NTSC standards (USA, Canada, Japan, etc.) specify 29.97 frame/s. Film is shot at the slower frame rate of 24 frames per second, which slightly complicates the process of transferring a cinematic motion picture to video. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Streaming</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Digital</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Framerate</span></p>

          <p>"The Difficult Lesson" by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1884).Falconry lesson A lesson is a structured period of time where learning is intended to occur. It involves one or more students (also called pupils or learners in some circumstances) being taught by a teacher or instructor. A lesson may be either one section of a textbook (which, apart from the printed page, can also include multimedia) or, more frequently, a short period of time during which learners are taught about a particular subject or taught how to perform a particular activity. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Learn</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Difficult</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Lesson</span></p>

          <p>Aspect ratio describes the proportional relationship between the width and height of video screens and video picture elements. All popular video formats are rectangular, and so can be described by a ratio between width and height. The ratio width to height for a traditional television screen is 4:3, or about 1.33:1. High definition televisions use an aspect ratio of 16:9, or about 1.78:1. The aspect ratio of a full 35 mm film frame with soundtrack (also known as the Academy ratio) is 1.375:1. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Ratio</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Width</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Height</span></p>

          <p>Different layers of video transmission and storage each provide their own set of formats to choose from. For transmission, there is a physical connector and signal protocol ("video connection standard" below). A given physical link can carry certain "display standards" that specify a particular refresh rate, display resolution, and color space. Many analog and digital recording formats are in use, and digital video clips can also be stored on a computer file system as files, which have their own formats. In addition to the physical format used by the data storage device or transmission medium, the stream of ones and zeros that is sent must be in a particular digital video compression format, of which a number are available. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#FormatVideo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Digital</span></p>

                  <p>Questions have developed a range of uses that go beyond the simple eliciting of information from another party. Rhetorical questions, for example, are used to make a point, and are not expected to be answered. Many languages have special grammatical forms for questions (for example, in the English sentence "Are you happy?", the inversion of the subject you and the verb are shows it to be a question rather than a statement). However, questions can also be asked without using these interrogative grammatical structures – for example one may use an imperative, as in "Tell me your name".</p>

Video editing is used to structure and present all video information, including films and television shows, video advertisements and video essays.

                <p class="ratingdescription">Video editing is the process of editing segments of motion video production footage, special effects and sound recordings in the post-production process. Motion picture film editing is a predecessor to video editing and, in several ways, video editing simulates motion picture film editing, in theory and the use of linear video editing and video editing software on non-linear editing systems (NLE). Using video, a director can communicate non-fictional and fictional events. The goals of editing is to manipulate these events to bring the communication closer to the original goal or target. It is a visual art.</p>

                  <p>Improvements in quality and economy, and the invention of the flying erase-head, allowed new video and audio material to be recorded over the material already recorded on an existing magnetic tape and was introduced into the linear editing technique. If a scene closer to the beginning of the video tape needed to be changed in length, all later scenes would need to be recorded onto the video tape again in sequence. In addition, sources could be played back simultaneously through a vision mixer (video switcher) to create more complex transitions between scenes.</p>

                  <p>There was a transitional analog period using multiple source videocassette recorder (VCR)s with the EditDroid using LaserDisc players, but modern NLE systems edit video digitally captured onto a hard drive from an analog video or digital video source. Content is ingested and recorded natively with the appropriate codec that the video editing software uses to process captured footage. High-definition video is becoming more popular and can be readily edited using the same video editing software along with related motion graphics programs.</p>

                <p class="ratingdescription">Like some other technologies, the cost of video editing has declined by an order of magnitude or more. The original 2" Quadruplex system cost so much that many television production facilities could only afford a single unit and editing was a highly involved process requiring special training. In contrast to this, nearly any home computer sold since the year 2000 has the speed and storage capacity to digitize and edit standard-definition television (SDTV). The two major retail operating systems include basic video editing software - Apple's iMovie and Microsoft's Windows Movie Maker. Additional options exist, usually as more advanced commercial products. As well as these commercial products, there are opensource[3] video-editing programs. Automatic video editing products have also emerged, opening up video editing to a broader audience of amateurs and reducing the time it takes to edit videos. These exist usually as media storage services, such as Google with its Google Photos[4] or smaller companies like Vidify.</p>
