    <p class="contentprewboxinfo-box-kindsofdesc">The school that became Texas A&M University, the first public institution of higher education in Texas, was founded in 1871 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. Established under the Morrill Act of 1862, it was originally proposed as a branch of the yet-to-be-created University of Texas, but the Texas legislature never gave that university any authority over Texas A&M. For much of its first century, enrollment was restricted to white men who were willing to participate in the Corps of Cadets and receive military training.</p>

          <p>Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and display of moving visual media. Video was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) systems which were later replaced by flat panel displays of several types. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Videomaking</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Videoediting</span></p>

          <p>Video technology was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) television systems, but several new technologies for video display devices have since been invented. Video was originally exclusively a live technology. Charles Ginsburg led an Ampex research team developing one of the first practical video tape recorder (VTR). In 1951 the first video tape recorder captured live images from television cameras by converting the camera's electrical impulses and saving the information onto magnetic video tape. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#VideoHistory</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#CRT</span></p>

          <p>The use of digital techniques in video created digital video, which allows higher quality and, eventually, much lower cost than earlier analog technology. After the invention of the DVD in 1997 and Blu-ray Disc in 2006, sales of videotape and recording equipment plummeted. Advances in computer technology allows even inexpensive personal computers and smartphones to capture, store, edit and transmit digital video, further reducing the cost of video production, allowing program-makers and broadcasters to move to tapeless production. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#VideoHistory</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Digital</span></p>

          <p>Frame rate, the number of still pictures per unit of time of video, ranges from six or eight frames per second (frame/s) for old mechanical cameras to 120 or more frames per second for new professional cameras. PAL standards (Europe, Asia, Australia, etc.) and SECAM (France, Russia, parts of Africa etc.) specify 25 frame/s, while NTSC standards (USA, Canada, Japan, etc.) specify 29.97 frame/s. Film is shot at the slower frame rate of 24 frames per second, which slightly complicates the process of transferring a cinematic motion picture to video. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Streaming</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Digital</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Framerate</span></p>

          <p>"The Difficult Lesson" by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1884).Falconry lesson A lesson is a structured period of time where learning is intended to occur. It involves one or more students (also called pupils or learners in some circumstances) being taught by a teacher or instructor. A lesson may be either one section of a textbook (which, apart from the printed page, can also include multimedia) or, more frequently, a short period of time during which learners are taught about a particular subject or taught how to perform a particular activity. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Learn</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Difficult</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Lesson</span></p>

          <p>Aspect ratio describes the proportional relationship between the width and height of video screens and video picture elements. All popular video formats are rectangular, and so can be described by a ratio between width and height. The ratio width to height for a traditional television screen is 4:3, or about 1.33:1. High definition televisions use an aspect ratio of 16:9, or about 1.78:1. The aspect ratio of a full 35 mm film frame with soundtrack (also known as the Academy ratio) is 1.375:1. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Ratio</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Width</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Height</span></p>

          <p>Different layers of video transmission and storage each provide their own set of formats to choose from. For transmission, there is a physical connector and signal protocol ("video connection standard" below). A given physical link can carry certain "display standards" that specify a particular refresh rate, display resolution, and color space. Many analog and digital recording formats are in use, and digital video clips can also be stored on a computer file system as files, which have their own formats. In addition to the physical format used by the data storage device or transmission medium, the stream of ones and zeros that is sent must be in a particular digital video compression format, of which a number are available. <br><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Demo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Video</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#FormatVideo</span><span class="TAGPREWWATHC">#Digital</span></p>
